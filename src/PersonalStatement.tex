\summary{
    I am a Senior Software Engineer with 5 years of experience in
    backend / distributed systems studying part-time for a masters in
    computer science specializing in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech.
    My experience in industry and developing frameworks / tools has led
    me to a deep appreciation of the power of abstraction in software
    systems. Through my master's program, I learned the foundations of
    deep learning and the techniques behind state-of-the-art AI models.
    I am looking to combine my experiences to develop frameworks and
    tooling within the Machine Learning domain with great abstractions
    and optimized performance.
